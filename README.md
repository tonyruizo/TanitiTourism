# Taniti Tourism

*A project for a User Experience Design Class.*

****Steps Taken:****

1. Persona Profile Research & Creation
2. Wireframing & Flow Diagram using **Figma**
3. Created the Prototype for the design and usability using HTML and CSS
4. Guerrilla Usability Testing with *three users* to evaluate a product
5. Made changes according to the feedback if they were actionable
6. Created five usability tasks for *three peers* to test
7. Applied changes according to peers' reviews, feedback and task results

> After submitting the HTML/CSS Prototype, I decided to recreate the website and expand on it using the front-end web framework **Blazor** from the **.NET platform**. I made a few improvements and added features outside the scope of the project's requirements for the user and my personal experience.

** *Most of the text content is provided by WGU, but I have added additional text for the demonstration*.
