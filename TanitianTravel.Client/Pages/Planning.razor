                        <p>Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship
                            that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small
                            airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process
                            of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the
                            next few years. </p>
